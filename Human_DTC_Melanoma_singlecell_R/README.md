# 10k Human DTC Melanoma, Chromium GEM-X SingleCell 3'
## Single Cell Gene Expression Dataset by Cell Ranger 8.0.0

## Library Inputs/Outputs
Dissociated tumor cells (DTCs) from melanoma tissue (female, age 50-60) were obtained by 10x
Genomics from Discovery Life Sciences.
Gene Expression libraries were generated as outlined in the Chromium GEM-X Single Cell 3' Reagent
Kits v4 User Guide (CG000731) and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 with approximately
70,000 read pairs per cell.
Paired-end, dual indexing:
28 cycles Read 1
10 cycles i7
10 cycles i5
90 cycles Read 2

The cellranger multi pipeline in Cell Ranger v8.0.0 was used to analyze libraries.
