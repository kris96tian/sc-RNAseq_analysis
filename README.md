Single-Cell RNA-seq Analysis Protocol using R and Seurat

Objective:
Comprehensive analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data using R and the Seurat package to unveil cellular heterogeneity and expression patterns.

The key steps include loading input data files, installing necessary packages, preparing data matrices, creating a Seurat object, 
conducting quality control, normalizing data, performing dimensionality reduction, clustering cells, and visualizing results using 
various plots such as violin plots and scatter plots.
